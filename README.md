Bond valuation and Analysis

Overview:

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of bond price valuation, incorporating duration and convexity to model the sensitivity of bond prices to changes in interest rates. The primary goal of this project is to evaluate bond price predictions over time and assess the impact of interest rate fluctuations using Moody’s DAAA yield data from 2024.

Key Techniques Used:
Duration Analysis: Measures the sensitivity of the bond’s price to small interest rate changes. Duration helps in estimating the approximate price change of a bond for a given change in interest rates.

Convexity Analysis: Aids in measuring the curvature in the bond price-yield relationship. It accounts for the non-linear price changes and refines bond price predictions for large interest rate shifts.

Cash Flow Analysis: The bond’s cash flows (coupon payments and face value) are discounted using the yield curve to calculate the present value, determining the bond’s price.


Outcome & Results:
Bond Price Sensitivity: The analysis showed how the bond price fluctuates based on interest rate changes, with duration providing an estimate for small yield changes and convexity refining this estimate for larger changes.

Visualization: Graphs and plots were generated to show the relationship between the bond price, yield, duration, and convexity. This allows a clear understanding of how these factors interact and affect the bond valuation.

Conclusion: The bond price can be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates. Duration
